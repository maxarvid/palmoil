For Golden Veroleum Liberia Inc., it began with a letter. Golden Veroleum is a palm oil company, with a large concession on the Liberian coast since 2010. This summer it ended its membership in the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, an industry-led multi-stakeholder group which aims to ensure the sustainability of palm oil, because of a complaint filed against the company in 2012. </p> </div> </div>  <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-md-10"> <p class="label super-font">Liberian Palm Oil Concessions</p> <p class="label-text super-font">There are eight palm oil concessions in Liberia.

Innocuous sounding vegetable oil packs a slew of social and environmental <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/magazine/palm-oil-borneo-climate-catastrophe.html">harms</a> , to the point that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/05/iceland-banned-palm-oil-advert-should-have-aired-says-itv-chief">supermarkets</a> go to great lengths to ban the sale of products containing palm oil in their stores. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-lg-10 "> <p class="subhead super-font">A complicated context</p> <p class="body-text sub-font"> Palm oil grows best in recently deforested areas near the equator. Concessions have in the past been accompanied by accusations of land-grabbing, with indigenous populations particularly at risk. Only natural then that the industry has bounded together and formed the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to address and mitigate some of these social harms (considering how much more difficult it would be to respond to the environmental ones). </p> </div> </div> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-12"> <img class="image" src="/palmoil/hansenLiberia.ef92ea1e.png" alt="image description"> </div> <div class="col-md-10"> <p class="caption sub-font">Hansen et al.

Liberian officials were possibly aware of this when they invited Golden Veroleum to explore new concessions in the south of the country.<br> It would be simplistic to make claims that concessions were granted for the enrichment of the few. Liberia is a country that has, not too long ago, experienced several civil wars, an Ebola epidemic and as a result has a very limited commodity trade. </p> </div> <div class="col-lg-8 sticky"> <div id="chart-1"></div> <div class="col-md-5"> <p class="caption sub-font">SOURCE: Global Forest Watch, World Bank</p> </div> </div> <div class="col-lg-4"> <div class="step" id="intro-graph"> <p>So who produces the most palm oil?</p> </div> <div class="step" id="area-palm-oil"> <p>Make no mistake, <strong>Indonesia</strong> is still the largest producer of palm oil.<br> They are far ahead in terms of area of palm oil concessions.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="percent-farm-land"> <p>But if we consider portion of available farm land, <strong>Liberia</strong> has dedicated more land for palm oil production.<br> We can thus deduce the importance and opportunity the Liberian government saw in palm oil.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-6 sticky"> <div id="chart-map"></div> </div> <div class="col-md-6"> <div class="step" id="intro-map"> <p>Indonesia, Malaysia, Liberia, Cameroon, and the Republic of Congo are some of the palm oil exporting countrties in the world.</p> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-6"> <div class="step" id="equator-map"> <p>These countries all lie in close proximity to the equator.</p> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-6"> <div class="step" id="expand-map"> <p>So what other countries export palm oil?</p> </div> </div> </div>  <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-md-6"> <div id="chart-4"></div> <div class="col-md-5"> <p class="caption sub-font">NOTE: Liberia data is missing<br> SOURCE: UN Trade Data</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-md-6"> <p class="body-text sub-font">An examination of the UN's import-export data confirms Indonesia and Malaysia in their respective, expected lead.

A convoluted process, appearing to favor the company, has since passed. This summer Golden Veroleum lost its final appeal against the Roundtableâ€™s Complaints Panel.<br> One would hope that this would result the company stepping up to its obligations (set by the Roundtable), but no, Golden Veroleum decided to leave the club. In so doing, the company shows that industry-led initiatives are not sufficient in dealing with disputes that arise between palm oil companies and the people who live where these companies operate.</p> </div> </div>    <script src="/palmoil/chart-1.9cf4196a.js"></script> <script src="/palmoil/chart-2.31d10375.js"></script> <script src="/palmoil/chart-map.01317fd8.js"></script> <script src="/palmoil/chart-4.f89bebaa.js"></script> <script src="/palmoil/chart-5.eb084b50.js"></script> <script src="/palmoil/scrollytelling.9bec811a.js"></script> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-ZMP7rVo3mIykV+2+9J3UJ46jBk0WLaUAdn689aCwoqbBJiSnjAK/l8WvCWPIPm49" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-smHYKdLADwkXOn1EmN1qk/HfnUcbVRZyYmZ4qpPea6sjB/pTJ0euyQp0Mk8ck+5T" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> </body> </html>
